# --- Shared-module bootstrap ------------------------------------------------

# loader (importlib.util.spec_from_file_location), which registers each file
# under a synthetic "<package>.nodes.<stem>" name WITHOUT importing any parent
# package: package-relative imports therefore cannot work here. Instead we put
# this directory on sys.path and import the shared module absolutely, so every
# node resolves the SAME module instance (one ANY_TYPE singleton pack-wide).

# one entry PER KEY, so a second alias key made every node appear TWICE in
# the Add Node search. Old workflows referencing the removed keys must be
