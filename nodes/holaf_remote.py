# follows the AIH naming convention (AIH<PascalCase>, no Node suffix).
# Legacy alias keys were removed (user decision): /api/object_info exposes
# one entry PER KEY, so a second alias key made every node appear TWICE in
# the Add Node search. Old workflows referencing the removed keys must be
# redone.
